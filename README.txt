This reposoitory was built to support automated DevOps deployment of DataPower assets using IBM DevOps Deploy.   The repository follows a DevOps folder structure: dp_projects/projxxxx/requests. 

The idea is that developers can commit to a git repository new requests for deployments.   IBM DevOps Deploy will integrate with this repository to provide the deployment automation.

This is an example implementation to provide a demo of what is possible to bring DevOps to DataPower installations.
